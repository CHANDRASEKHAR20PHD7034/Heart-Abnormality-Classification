# Introduction:                                                                                                                                                              
 
# Contribution 
The main contributions of the proposed research work are discussed as follows,

- To enhance the HD diagnosis classification accuracy by considering both ECG and PCG signals.  
- To reduce the noise of the signal using **BrF-BLF** and **FR-BWF** approaches for ECG and PCG signals, respectively.  
- To decompose the signal to extract more information from the input signal using the **HEEMD** approach.  
- To ensure the abnormality of heart disease by using the rule generation function and **RFFC clustering** approach.  
- To reduce the computational complexity of the research by selecting important features using the **PDF-SLO** approach.  
- To accurately diagnose the types of HD using the novel **PJM-DJRNN** approach.
