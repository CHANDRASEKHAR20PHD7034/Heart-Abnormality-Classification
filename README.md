Heart Abnormality Classification Using ECG and PCG Recordings 



**Introduction:** Heart Disease (HD) is a chronic and life-threatening disease considered a significant health concern worldwide[1],[2]. HD is a medical condition that affects the heart or blood vessels, encompassing various disorders, such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and related diseases [3]. Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and the use of alcohol and tobacco are some of the risk factors associated with HD [4],[5].Males are more likely to be affected by HD than females, especially in middle or old age [6]. Early identification of HD and high-risk individuals using a prediction model can reduce the fatality rate and improve decision-making for further treatment and prevention [7]. Clinically, HD can be identified by analyzing these various types of diagnostic data, including Phonocardiogram (PCG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and cardiac colour Doppler ultrasound [8]. Among these data, ECG and PCG signals are particularly important for the timely detection and diagnosis of HD. In fact, these signals are instrumental in predicting the onset of HD and facilitating its early diagnosis [9]. The combination of ECG and PCG can provide accurate information about heart murmurs and other abnormal heart sounds, aiding in precise diagnosis [10]. The most commonly used method for diagnosing HD is angiography, considered the most precise way, but it has significant side effects and high costs [11]. However, the manual prediction of HD through the abovementioned diagnosing method is a complex task, time-consuming, and requires numerous medical professionals. Providing surgical treatment for HD presents significant challenges, particularly in developing countries where trained personnel, testing equipment, and other essential resources are not readily available [12]. These problems have led to the need for the development of non-invasive methods for HD detection.Considering the limitations of manual diagnosis of HDs, scientists have begun to use modern techniques, such as data mining, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning(DL) approaches to identify the disease[13],[14].
