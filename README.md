# Introduction:                                                                                                                                                              
Heart Disease (HD) is a chronic and life-threatening disease considered a significant health concern worldwide[1],[2]. HD is a medical condition that affects the heart or blood vessels, encompassing various disorders, such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and related diseases [3]. Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and the use of alcohol and tobacco are some of the risk factors associated with HD [4],[5]. Males are more likely to be affected by HD than females, especially in middle or old age [6]. Early identification of HD and high-risk individuals using a prediction model can reduce the fatality rate and improve decision-making for further treatment and prevention [7]. Clinically, HD can be identified by analyzing these various types of diagnostic data, including Phonocardiogram (PCG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and cardiac color Doppler ultrasound [8]. Among these data, ECG and PCG signals are vital for the timely detection and diagnosis of HD. These signals are instrumental in predicting HD onset and facilitating early diagnosis [9]. The combination of ECG and PCG can provide accurate information about heart murmurs and other abnormal heart sounds, aiding in precise diagnosis [10]. The most commonly used method for diagnosing HD is angiography, which is considered the most precise method, but it has significant side effects and high costs [11]. However, the manual prediction of HD through the abovementioned diagnosing method is a complex task, time-consuming, and requires numerous medical professionals. Providing surgical treatment for HD presents significant challenges, particularly in developing countries where trained personnel, testing equipment, and other essential resources are not readily available [12]. These problems have led to the need for the development of non-invasive methods for HD detection. Considering the limitations of manual diagnosis of HDs, scientists have begun to use modern techniques, such as data mining, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning(DL) approaches to identify the disease[13],[14]. Therefore, this research proposes a novel method for predicting HD and its classification using ECG and PCG signals using the Polynomial Jacobian Matrix-based Deep Jordan Recurrent Neural Network (PJM-DJRNN) DL technique. The main contribution of the proposed method is to enhance HD classification prediction using both ECG and PCG signals. This can be achieved by incorporating the Brownian Functional-based Bessel Filter (BrF-BLF) and Frequency Ratio-based Butter-Worth Filter (FR-BWF) to obtain better input signals. Hamming-based Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (HEEMD) will aid in achieving decomposed signals without encountering the mode mixing problem on both ECG and PCG signals. Finally, using PJM-DJRNN is expected to result in an accurate prediction of HD classification.
